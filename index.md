## Brainstorming Prompts

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
Lean privacy Review is the main topic that our team focusing on. The funniest part of this project is produce an IDE to deliver the concept of privacy by design. Ranging form differential privacy to dual process cognitive theory, this involve a lot of domain specific knowledge and implementation skill from the major courses. Currently I really enjoy in developing the IDE by using React which is a very useful self-learnt skill.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
The potential investigation include a deliverable application (IDE) which allow users (currently students) is discover and learn the privacy pattern through the React Flowchart and slef-generated dynamic survey from our IDE.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
One potential change would be to focus on improving the user experience (UX) of the IDE by integrating more intuitive design elements. For example, implementing real-time feedback on user actions within the IDE, such as dynamic error handling or visual cues for privacy violations, could make the learning process more engaging and effective. Additionally, incorporating AI-driven suggestions for privacy patterns based on user input would enhance the tool's utility.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I would like to explore integrating machine learning techniques to analyze user interactions within the IDE. This could include clustering methods to identify common learning patterns or predictive models to suggest next steps based on a user's progress. Another interesting technique would be the use of natural language processing (NLP) to allow users to query the IDE in plain language and receive personalized feedback on privacy patterns or principles.
