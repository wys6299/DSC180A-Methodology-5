**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
An investigation into the biases in machine learning models trained on user-generated content, specifically analyzing disparities in predictions based on demographic features.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
Implement feature engineering techniques to better preprocess textual data, such as word embeddings or sentiment scores, to improve classification accuracy.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
Exploring transformer-based models like BERT or GPT for text classification tasks and comparing their performance with traditional methods like logistic regression.
